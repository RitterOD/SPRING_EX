### Clean Architecture example

Based on article:
- [Clean Architecture with Spring Boot](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-clean-architecture)

Levels:
- Level 1 : Frameworks/Drivers
- Level 2 : Interface Adapters 
- Level 3 : Use cases
- Level 4 : Entities

1. Split to different packages -> Add public modifiers to classes and methods.
   1. Is it right?
   2. Is splitting to packages right? Where put adapter dto's and interfaces ?
